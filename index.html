        <h3 class="who-i-am">Me</h3>
        <p class="who-i-am-text">I like screens. I use them all day, for work, personal endeavors (like mostly-defunct blogs), and baseball. I went to film school at NYU. I worked in "show business" for eight years, including gigs on various movies and a season at <em>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</em>. I have a wife (who created the banner image with detailed instructions from me to "make something creative") and a seven-year-old son. Two years ago I switched gears and went back to school to work on a second bachelor's degree, this time in computer science.</p>

          <p class="what-i-do-now-text">Without knowing a thing about web performance, I applied to a job as "consulting support" in web performance analysis. Luckily, I have a way with words, and my cover letter and subsequent interviews got me in the door. Long story short, I still haven't finished that second degree, but I've spent the last 26 months working in web performance for Dynatrace (formerly Keynote). So I look at waterfalls all day to understand how web page design affects performance.</p>
          <p class="what-i-do-now-text-2">Here's a hint from this anonymous site: don't have three CSS and nine JS files in your first dozen elements to load. Your page will be slower than necessary. Combine, combine, combine.</p>

        <h3 class="what-i-want-to-do">My Future</h3>
          <p class="what-i-want-to-do-text">I'm moving up at Dynatrace, with a recent promotion to "Performance Guardian." That means the clients I've been supporting (a major domestic car company and an international cell phone carrier) are about to be disappointed to learn I'm moving on. I'll soon have my own (smaller) clients. But I'm learning how to develop websites myself because I enjoy this type of work. So eventually I'd like to be able to call myself a web designer/developer. My experience in knowing how to put together a website for maximum performance should come in handy as I learn... how to put together a website. In the meantime, monitoring and analyzing others' sites is what pays the bills.</p>
