      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>For the last two years, I have lived and breathed web performance analysis. I started off not knowing a single thing about how a web page loads, and now I spend my days advising companies on how best to improve their sites to get the most out of them.</p>
      <p>A lot of people don't like to listen to my company's advice, which is bad because it gets annoying to repeat one's self. But it's also good because it means as long as developers insist on putting JS into 20 different files on a page, I will always have a job. Someone has to tell them, "Quit doing that. It slows things down. Combine wherever you can."</p>
